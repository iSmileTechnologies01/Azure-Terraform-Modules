There is a difference between naming a subnet as Gateway and having a Gateway Subnet.
In the image above, the "before" shows a subnet being named as Gateway which will be considered 
as normal subnet.But in the "Now" the subnet has actually been configured to act as a gatewaysubnet
and hence you see the "Available IPs" have different values for both.
